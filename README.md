# Original Histacom Source
## NEW PROJECT: https://github.com/TheRandomMelon/Histacom2

This is repo contains the original source in two forms.

- The original untouched Source - This was the final version of Histacom as it was before Philip stopped working on it.
- HistacomVB Source - The changes I made to the source after Philip stopped working on it (see below).

## HistacomVB
After Philip stopped working on it, two new projects were started up: TimeHACK and HistacomVB.

TimeHACK (later became Histacom2) was a rewrite of Histacom from the ground up.
However, while TimeHACK was going on, there was also HistacomVB, which was the original source of Histacom, which I worked on for a while before abandoning it and moving onto TimeHACK.
The only real changes I made was a project re-structure, and border being added dynamically as windows are opened.

## In this repo
